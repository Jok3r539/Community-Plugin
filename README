Welcome to the Community Plugin GitHub page!
To get started just make a fork, edit it and send a pull request to me and it will be pulled!
Rules:
    Only contribute if you know basic coding.
    Don't type random code.
    Make sure there are no errors in your code. I suggest you use Eclipse to edit them then copy and paste.
    Has to be resonable - IE, No explosions with a float of more than 4F :P
    No inappropriate language.

Thats it! Now start coding! :D
